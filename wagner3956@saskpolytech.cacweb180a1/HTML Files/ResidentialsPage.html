<h2>About Residential Schools</h2>

<p>Residential schools were schools that First Nations children were taken to
and forced to live in without contact with their parents. The idea behind
residential schools was to assimilate the children into European societal
norms. They operated for more than 160 years, and more than 150,000 children
were taken to the schools. The last residential school was closed in 1996.</p>

<p>There were many problems with residential schools. First of all, the children
were taken from their parents without any choice. Another problem was that
the children were not allowed to speak their own languages, and were forced
to speak English. They were often not allowed to perform their own cultural
ceremonies and were forced to follow Christian religions, as the schools were
    run by churches.</p>

<p>Residential schools were also segregated between boys and girls, so brothers
and sisters were separated. Children in residential schools were subject to
emotional, physical and in some cases sexual abuse. Children were fed
poor-quality food. There were many other problems with residential schools,
too many to be documented on this simple web page.</p>
