<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A few quotes will show how the government of Canada treated the First Nations.
They thought of them as a problem and were only concerned with how to
    assimilate them into the general population.</p>

<blockquote> The happiest future for the Indian race is absorption into the general population,
and this is the object of the policy of our government. The great forces of
intermarriage and education will finally overcome the lingering traces of
    native customs and traditions.</blockquote>
<p>- Duncan Campbell Scott, Department of Indian Affairs, 1876</p>

<blockquote> The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and
assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the
    dominion as speedily as they are fit to change.</blockquote>
<p>- John A Macdonald, 1887</p>

<blockquote> If anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young. The
    children must be kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions.</blockquote>
<p>- Nicholas Flood Davin, Report on Industrial schools for Indians and Half-breeds, 1879</p>

<blockquote> If you wish to educate these children you must separate them from their parents during
the time that they are being educated. If you leave them in the family they may know
how to read and write, but they still remain savages, whereas by separating them in
the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes it is to be hoped only the good
tastes of civilized people.</blockquote>
<p>- Hector Langevin, Public Works Minister, 1883</p>

<blockquote> I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the
country out to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone....
Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not
been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian
department, that is the whole object of this Bill.</blockquote>
<p>- Duncan Campbell Scott, Department of Indian Affairs, 1920</p>
