    <p>Sask Polytech will observe September 30th as an official holiday, annually beginning in 2021.
    There will be no classes held on this date.  Sask Polytech will offer all faculty, staff and
        students a day off to recognize the significance of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.</p>

    <p>The National Day for Truth and Reconciliation provides an opportunity to recognize and commemorate
    the legacy of residential schools.  This date coincides with Orange Shirt Day, which began in 2013
    and involves wearing orange shirts to honour Indigenous children forced to leave their families to
    attend residential schools.  Sask Polytech will move our Orange Shirt Day events to September 29th
        to accommodate the holiday.</p>

    <p>Let's take this time to work together to create an inclusive, collaborative and respectful
        environment in which our community can grow, thrive, and in which we lift each other up.</p>

    <p> Sask Polytech acknowledges generations of Indigenous faculty, staff and learners as integral to
    our community, and we are committed to Indigenization.  That commitment includes holistically
    integrating Indigenous ways of knowing, being, teaching and learning throughout all institutional
        practices, procedures and services.</p>

    <p>The Cree phrase, <strong>miyo wahkohtowin</strong>, expresses the value and positivity of interconnectedness and
    relationships.  Let us all honour this principle throughout every interaction, institutional
        practice, procedure, policy and service provided to our campus communities.</p>

    <p>Establishing a national holiday to commemorate the tragic legacy of residential schools in Canada
        was one of the 94 recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>

    <p>We hope our campus communities can use this time to come together in the spirit of reconciliation
    to remember and honour the First Nations, M&eacute;tis and Inuit children who survived the residential
        school system, and those who were lost.</p>
