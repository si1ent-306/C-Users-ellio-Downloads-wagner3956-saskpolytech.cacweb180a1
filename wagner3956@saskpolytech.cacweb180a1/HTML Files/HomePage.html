    <h2>Reasons for Reconciliation</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>You probably know that there were indigenous people in Saskatchewan
        thousands of years before Europeans reached North America. Perhaps you
        know that there were treaties between these people and the government
        of Canada. Maybe you have even seen that Saskatchewan Polytechnic is on
            Treaty 4 and Treaty 6 territory and the homelands of the M&eacute;tis people.</p>

        <p>But you may not know the reasons why there has to be reconciliation
        between Canadians and the First Nations. If the treaties were supposed
        to be agreements on how these parties were supposed to treat each other,
        why is reconciliation necessary? This website will briefly touch on a
        few of the causes and examine residential schools in a bit more detail.</p>

    <h3>Reasons</h3>

    <h4>I. Treaties</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> The treaties were not fully carried out.</li>
        <li> The government acted if the treaties were just land transactions.</li>
        <li> The First Nations had a different perspective on treaties.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>II. Residential Schools - see the web page</h4>
    <h4>III. The Pass System</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> First Nations people were not allowed to leave their reserves without
        a pass from the Indian agent.</li>
        <li> This system was never enshrined in law, but was carried out nonetheless.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>IV. Voting - First Nations people didn't have the full right to vote until 1960</h4>
    <h4>V. The <em>"Sixties Scoop"</em> - children were taken from their families into the</h4>
        child welfare system
    <h4>VI. Ban on First Nations Cultural Ceremonies</h4>
