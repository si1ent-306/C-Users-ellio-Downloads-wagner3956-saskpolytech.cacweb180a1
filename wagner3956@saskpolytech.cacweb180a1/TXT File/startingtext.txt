Reasons for Reconciliation

Introduction

You probably know that there were indigenous people in Saskatchewan
thousands of years before Europeans reached North America. Perhaps you
know that there were treaties between these people and the government
of Canada. Maybe you have even seen that Saskatchewan Polytechnic is on
Treaty 4 and Treaty 6 territory and the homelands of the Metis people.

But you may not know the reasons why there has to be reconciliation
between Canadians and the First Nations. If the treaties were supposed
to be agreements on how these parties were supposed to treat each other,
why is reconciliation necessary? This website will briefly touch on a
few of the causes and examine residential schools in a bit more detail.

Reasons

I. Treaties
   * The treaties were not fully carried out.
   * The government acted if the treaties were just land transactions.
   * The First Nations had a different perspective on treaties.
II. Residential Schools - see the web page
III. The Pass System
   * First Nations people were not allowed to leave their reserves without
     a pass from the Indian agent.
   * This system was never enshrined in law, but was carried out nonetheless.
IV. Voting - First Nations people didn't have the full right to vote until 1960
V. The "Sixties Scoop" - children were taken from their families into the
   child welfare system
VI. Ban on First Nations Cultural Ceremonies

RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS PAGE
========================
About Residential Schools

Residential schools were schools that First Nations children were taken to
and forced to live in without contact with their parents. The idea behind
residential schools was to assimilate the children into European societal
norms. They operated for more than 160 years, and more than 150,000 children
were taken to the schools. The last residential school was closed in 1996.

There were many problems with residential schools. First of all, the children
were taken from their parents without any choice. Another problem was that
the children were not allowed to speak their own languages, and were forced
to speak English. They were often not allowed to perform their own cultural
ceremonies and were forced to follow Christian religions, as the schools were
run by churches.

Residential schools were also segregated between boys and girls, so brothers
and sisters were separated. Children in residential schools were subject to
emotional, physical and in some cases sexual abuse. Children were fed
poor-quality food. There were many other problems with residential schools,
too many to be documented on this simple web page.

QUOTES PAGE
===========
Introduction

A few quotes will show how the government of Canada treated the First Nations.
They thought of them as a problem and were only concerned with how to
assimilate them into the general population.

The happiest future for the Indian race is absorption into the general population,
and this is the object of the policy of our government. The great forces of
intermarriage and education will finally overcome the lingering traces of
native customs and traditions.
- Duncan Campbell Scott, Department of Indian Affairs, 1876

The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and
assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the
dominion as speedily as they are fit to change.
- John A Macdonald, 1887

If anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young. The
children must be kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions.
- Nicholas Flood Davin, Report on Industrial schools for Indians and Half-breeds, 1879

If you wish to educate these children you must separate them from their parents during
the time that they are being educated. If you leave them in the family they may know
how to read and write, but they still remain savages, whereas by separating them in
the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes – it is to be hoped only the good
tastes of civilized people.
- Hector Langevin, Public Works Minister, 1883

I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the
country out to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone....
Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not
been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian
department, that is the whole object of this Bill.
- Duncan Campbell Scott, Department of Indian Affairs, 1920

Saskatchewan Polytechnic to Observe National Day for Truth and Reconciliation
=============================================================================
Sask Polytech will observe September 30th as an official holiday, annually beginning in 2021.  
There will be no classes held on this date.  Sask Polytech will offer all faculty, staff and 
students a day off to recognize the significance of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. 

The National Day for Truth and Reconciliation provides an opportunity to recognize and commemorate 
the legacy of residential schools.  This date coincides with Orange Shirt Day, which began in 2013 
and involves wearing orange shirts to honour Indigenous children forced to leave their families to 
attend residential schools.  Sask Polytech will move our Orange Shirt Day events to September 29th 
to accommodate the holiday.

Let’s take this time to work together to create an inclusive, collaborative and respectful 
environment in which our community can grow, thrive, and in which we lift each other up.  

Sask Polytech acknowledges generations of Indigenous faculty, staff and learners as integral to 
our community, and we are committed to Indigenization.  That commitment includes holistically 
integrating Indigenous ways of knowing, being, teaching and learning throughout all institutional 
practices, procedures and services.

The Cree phrase, miyo wahkohtowin, expresses the value and positivity of interconnectedness and 
relationships.  Let us all honour this principle throughout every interaction, institutional 
practice, procedure, policy and service provided to our campus communities.

Establishing a national holiday to commemorate the tragic legacy of residential schools in Canada 
was one of the 94 recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 

We hope our campus communities can use this time to come together in the spirit of reconciliation 
to remember and honour the First Nations, Métis and Inuit children who survived the residential 
school system, and those who were lost.
